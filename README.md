# Simplex Algorithm
This program uses the simplex algorithm to solve basic linear programming problems.

To run it, enter all coefficients in the LP problem in a matrix in cplex.txt (see example), compile the cplex.c program using the following command in the terminal:
```gcc -Wall -Werror cplex.c -o cplex```, and then run the generated executable in the terminal.

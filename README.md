# Simplex Algorithm
This program uses the simplex algorithm to solve basic linear programming problems.

To run it, enter all constraints in the LP problem, followed by the LP problem objective function that will be minimised, into cplex.txt (see example), compile the cplex.c program using the following command in the terminal: ```gcc -Wall -Werror cplex.c -o cplex```, and then run the generated executable in the terminal.
